# PHP: Ignoring fclose() Return Value

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP file handling: ignoring the return value of `fclose()`.  The `fclose()` function can fail, and ignoring its return value means potential resource leaks and errors might go undetected.  The provided code shows the flawed code and a corrected version.

**Bug:** The original code opens a file, processes its contents, and then closes it. However, it neglects to check the return value of `fclose()`, making it oblivious to any errors that may occur during the closing process.

**Solution:** The solution code modifies the code to check the return value of `fclose()`, providing a way to detect and handle any errors that may occur during the file closing operation.  Appropriate error handling, such as logging or throwing an exception, is crucial in production environments.
